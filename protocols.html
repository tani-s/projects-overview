            <li class="comment">This prompt got my group thinking &mdash; not just about mask wearing, but about 
                COVID norms in general. We can just come back to campus and everyone was feeling the tension of
                not having clear-cut social protocol. Roommates wondered how to see other friends or significant
                others, about how to measure the risk of a meal out or a ride on public transit. We came up with
                a more specific research question: How might we make it easier for roommates or "pods" to establish
                and maintain agreed upon COVID norms?

            <li class="comment"> I ended up drafting a couple images of what a "Protocols App" might look like.
                My group brainstormed different things we'd want to see in an app. Starting with the basics: a 
                tool to agree upon norms, called "Protocols", with a group of people; resources on COVID testing
                and local rates of infection; maybe the ability to share test results with others... what about 
                contact tracing?
                <br><br>
                I fought for the inclusion of contact tracing in the app because I myself am a visual learner.
                I need to see something to understand it; I'd even sketched out a contact tracing network myself
                when I was thinking about seeing a friend who'd seen others since her last test. What if the app 
                could do that for you? People might take social distancing a little more seriously.
